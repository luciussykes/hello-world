# hello-world
I am stoked about the opportunity to learn as a developer. Gotta love today's learning options...

Hi Everyone, 

My name is Lucius, it is often misspelled or mispronounced but it's be passed down from my grandfather to my dad, and to me. It's mines. Lol, a little random though as I embark on this journey of discovery. I am really excited about this opportunity to develop my learning base with GitHub. 

Many thanks,
-Lucius
